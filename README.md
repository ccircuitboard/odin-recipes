This project is part of The Odin Project - an open source platform for learning full-stack development.
In this project I will be applying the basic HTML knowledge that I've acquired through studying TOP.

Reflections(24th of December 2024): This first stage of the project was a fun way to test my basic HTML knowledge that I've acquired so far. It helped me revise the usage of basic tags such as the basic boilerplate, p, img, a, and ul/ol. It also gave me some much needed practice with using git/github.
