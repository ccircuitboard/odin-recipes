    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you're a lover of Seafood and Pasta, the Maine Lobster Lasagne is the logical choice to combine both pleasures. If you're familiar with culinary blogs or other related media, you may have heard that Maine lobster is the best lobster in the world, making this dish all the more incredible. To briefly explain, Maine lobsters are exceptional because of many factors. Firstly, the Gulf of Maine is an ideal habitat for the lobsters. The waters are full of the essential nutrients for lobsters to grow the soft and delicious meat that makes this dish stand out. The rocky nature of the coast around the Gulf of Maine is also an ideal hidey-hole for the red little crustaceans, ensuring that they are safe to thrive and multiply in numbers extremely efficiently. Of course, you don't need a lobster from Maine specifically to cook this dish, however it would definitely make this dish one of a kind.</p>
    <p>Besides the intricacies of the lobster, the dish also features a rich creamy homemade alfredo sauce with layers of delicious pasta. This all combined with a mix of spinach, and three types of cheese: cheddar, parmesan, and ricotta. All of this is served with a side of tossed garden salad and oven-toasted garlic bread.</p>
